"""Traceability Matrix confirmation measures per ISO 26262, ISO 21434, IEEE 1012.

Rating vocabulary: FC / LC / PC / NO / NA.

Three classes of check live here and the `finding` text says which one produced
the rating, so nothing machine-unverified is presented as a machine verdict:

  * CONTENT   - read from the probed workbook and decided against a threshold
                (TM005-TM009). These can fail.
  * STRUCTURE - the required tab exists and carries rows. Presence only; it
                does not judge the content of the tab.
  * DRAFT     - not machine-verifiable from the workbook. Rated LC and labelled
                as an auto-suggest draft for the assessor to confirm or
                overturn. Previously these were an unlabelled hard-coded LC.
